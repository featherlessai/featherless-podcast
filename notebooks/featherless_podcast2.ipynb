    "1. **Text preparation**: Utilizing the extracted and processed text from the previous notebook\n",
    "2. **Prompt engineering**: Creating a detailed system prompt for AI-powered podcast generation\n",
    "3. **API interaction**: Communicating with the Featherless AI API\n",
    "4. **Content generation**: Turning informational text into engaging podcast dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated content simulates a conversation between two speakers with realistic speech patterns, interjections, and tone variations - perfect for creating engaging audio content."
